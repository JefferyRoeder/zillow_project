# README Zillow Project

The Zillow Project is a data science project using the Zillow dataset to attempt to calculate estimated home values based on May and June 2017 single residence homes using regression. The baseline model used square feet, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to capture estimated tax value.

## Prerequisites

The code was written in Python 3.7.3 and you will need to have pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn installed. Additionally you will need access to the Zillow dataset which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data

## Installing

You will need the following Python files from the respository to run the project: acquire.py, prep.py, split_scale.py, and model.ipynb

## Running the model

The model.ipynb file will run cell by cell to show the entire DS pipeline including analysis, visuals, and relevant statistical information.
